The time complexity of the solveNQueens method is O(N!), where N is the number of rows and columns in the chessboard. This is because there are N possibilities for placing the queen in the first row, N-2 possibilities for placing the queen in the second row (since the queen cannot be placed in the same column or diagonal as the queen in the first row), N-4 possibilities for placing the queen in the third row, and so on. Therefore, the total number of possible configurations is N*(N-2)(N-4)...31, which is equal to N!.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(N^2), which is the space required to store the boolean arrays for the diagonals and columns, as well as the temporary list of solutions. The size of the temporary list of solutions is also proportional to N^2, as each solution consists of N strings, each with N characters. Therefore, the space required by the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the chessboard.
