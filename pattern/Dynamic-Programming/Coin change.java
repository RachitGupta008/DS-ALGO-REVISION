// For time and space complexity always try to visualize in the form of a table in that way you can get a better idea of the time 
The given code is a solution to the Coin Change problem using a top-down dynamic programming approach (also known as memoization). The time complexity of this solution can be described as O(amount * n), where n is the number of coins in the coins array.

Here's why:

The function f is called with the remaining amount (the difference between the original amount and the sum of the coins selected so far) as its argument.
The worst-case scenario is when the function has to go through all the coins for each amount.
In this case, the function will be called amount * n times, where n is the number of coins.
Since the memoization technique is used to store intermediate results in the dp array, the time complexity is reduced to O(amount * n) as each subproblem is solved only once, and its result is cached for later use. The space complexity is also O(amount) because an Integer array of length amount + 1 is used for mem

class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        Integer[] dp = new Integer[amount+1];
        int ans = f(coins, amount, dp);
        if(ans == Integer.MAX_VALUE || ans == Integer.MAX_VALUE-1){
            return -1;
        }
        return ans;
    }

    // This is levels and choices method
    public int f(int[] coins, int amount, Integer[] dp){
        
     if(amount<0){
            return Integer.MAX_VALUE-1;
        }
        if(amount == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        if(dp[amount]!=null){
            return dp[amount];
        }
        
        
        int mcoins = Integer.MAX_VALUE-1;
        
        for(int i=0;i<coins.length;i++){
            
            mcoins = Math.min(mcoins, f(coins, amount-coins[i], dp));
        }
        
        if(mcoins!=Integer.MAX_VALUE-1)
            dp[amount] = mcoins+1;
        else
            dp[amount] = mcoins;
        return dp[amount];
        
        
    }
}
