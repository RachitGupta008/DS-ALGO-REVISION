Time Complexity: The time complexity of this algorithm is O(4^n / sqrt(n)). It is based on the nth Catalan number, which provides the count of valid parentheses combinations for a given 'n'. Since the algorithm generates each valid combination, its time complexity is proportional to the number of valid combinations.

Space Complexity: The space complexity of the algorithm is O(4^n / sqrt(n)). The primary sources of space consumption are the recursion stack during the backtracking process and the memory used for storing the valid parentheses combinations in the ans list. The depth of the recursion is limited by '2n' (the maximum length of a valid combination), but it does not affect the space complexity, as the number of valid combinations has a greater impact.

class Solution {
    // Function to generate all valid parentheses combinations
    public List<String> generateParenthesis(int n) {
        List<String> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        gen("", ans, 0, 0, n);
        return ans;
    }
   
    // Helper function for backtracking through all possible combinations
    void gen(String temp, List<String> ans, int no, int ns, int n) {
        // If the length of the temporary string is twice the input value 'n', 
        // a valid combination has been found, so add it to the answer list
        if (temp.length() == n * 2) {
            ans.add(temp);
            return;
        }

        // If there are still open parentheses left to close, 
        // add a closing parenthesis and continue exploring
        if (no > 0) {
            gen(temp + ")", ans, no - 1, ns, n);
        }
        // If the number of open parentheses is less than 'n', 
        // add an opening parenthesis and continue exploring
        if (ns < n) {
            gen(temp + "(", ans, no + 1, ns + 1, n);
        }
    }
}
